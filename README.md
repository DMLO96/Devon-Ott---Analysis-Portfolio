# About Me
Thanks for coming this deep into my portfolio! My name is Devon Ott and I am a Data Analyst based out of Northeast Ohio.
Academically, I have a history with Sociology and Statistics. At 19, I was promoted to Assistant Manager of a resteraunt and have since gained further work experience in various operational techniques.
Upon discovering the field of Data Analytics I recieved certification and applied my statistical skills to learning SQL and visualization softwares. Thankfully I was able to approach my certificate
having long term experience with spreadsheets.


## Noteable Projects:

SQL - Movie Opening Revenue (With Tableau Visualization)
  This SQL project involves anaylzing movie releases with the top earning openeing weekends since 1983. The SQL anaylsis demonstrates Disney's recent record breaking streak,
  but these feats overshadow the rest of the data. For that reason, a link to a very simple visualiton is on the bottom. I seperated Data between Disney and non-Disney releases
  and used bar charts to show that Super Hero films have preformed well even before Disney caught hold of Marvel. (PDF must be downloaded to access link)

  Excel - Bike Data Cleaning and Visualizing
    With this project I was tasked with cleaning a dirty data set for an international mountain bike supplier. I have provided a zip file with the original file, the clean file, a cleaning log, and visualizations showing profit for the month. There is one entry that can not be solved without access to inventory reports.
