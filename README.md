# About Me
Thanks for coming this deep into my portfolio! My name is Devon Ott and I am a Data Analyst based out of Northeast Ohio.
Academically, I have a history with Sociology and Statistics. At 19, I was promoted to Assistant Manager of a resteraunt and have since gained further work experience in various operational techniques.
Upon discovering the field of Data Analytics I recieved certification and applied my statistical skills to learning SQL and visualization softwares. Thankfully I was able to approach my certificate
having long term experience with spreadsheets.

## Noteable Projects:

### Tableau - Superstore Analysis Dashboard
  [Click Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devon.ott/viz/SuperstoreAnalysis_17085484350980/KPIs) to interact with the dashboard. You will find three layers, one for sale KPIs, one for regional sale analysis and another that contains an order log. Regional analysis has an interactive map that allows you to dig into both city and state.

### SQL - Movie Opening Revenue (With Tableau Visualization)
  This SQL project involves anaylzing movie releases with the top earning openeing weekends since 1983. The SQL anaylsis demonstrates Disney's recent record breaking streak,
  but these feats overshadow the rest of the data. For that reason, [a link to a very simple visualiton is provided](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devon.ott/viz/HighestMovieOpeningsDisneyvs_Non-Disney/HighestMovieOpenings). I seperated Data between Disney and non-Disney releases then used bar charts to show that Super Hero films have preformed well even before Disney caught hold of Marvel.

  ### Excel - Bike Data Cleaning and Visualizing
  With this project I was tasked with cleaning a dirty data set for an international mountain bike supplier. I have provided a zip file with the original file, the clean file, a cleaning log, and visualizations showing profit for the month. There is one entry that can not be solved without access to inventory reports.
